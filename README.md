TechTogether Boston 2019

We created a web app that connects randomly matched Boston College students by sending them on a trek across campus to iconic locations. Along the walk, students are encouraged to have meaningful and courageous conversations. Upon arrival, students engage in an activity in order to complete the challenge.

In the future, we would like to implement a point-based system that awards students for completing each trek and reflecting on their experience. We also envision splitting instructions between the two user devices in order to create a more codependent experience.
